                <p>Hi, I'm Jamie! My love for food began in my grandmother’s kitchen and has taken me around the world. After years of experimenting, tasting, and traveling, I created The Flavor Journey to share recipes that are inspired by cultures and flavors from all over. I hope this blog becomes a place where you feel encouraged to explore new dishes and make them your own.</p>
